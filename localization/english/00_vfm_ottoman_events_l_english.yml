 ottoman_dynasty.1.t:0 "The Death of Mahmud II"
 ottoman_dynasty.1.d:0 "Mahmud II passed away today after a long battle with tuberculosis, attended by his physicians, advisors, consorts and family. He leaves the throne in the hands of Abdulmecid as a capable successor. Born the youngest son of Abdulhamid, he came to the throne at only 13 after surviving an attempted assassination. His reign marked a period of territorial decline with the loss of Greece and Serbia, but also the beginnings of change with the destruction of the Jannisaries. He is survived by his heir and the new Sultan, Abdulmejid, his other son Abdulaziz and three daughters."
 ottoman_dynasty.1.f:0 "Sultan Mahmud-u sani, Caliph of all Islam, Commander of the Faithful, Hadimu'l-Haremeyn, Sultan of the two Lands, the Khan of the Seas, the Sultan son of the Sultan is forever victorious."
 ottoman_dynasty.1.a:0 "Oh soul at rest, return to your Lord."
 ottoman_dynasty.1.tt:0 "The Gulhane Edict may now be proclaimed"
 
 ottoman_dynasty.2.t:0 "The Death of Abdulmejid"
 ottoman_dynasty.2.d:0 "Abdulmejid I passed away late last night owing to medical complications related to his ongoing tuberculosis. Following in the footsteps of his faher Mahmud II, as Sultan he pushed for reforms to modernise the state and military and spoke well of the need maintain the unity and integrity of the Empire in this new century. His brother and heir, Abdulaziz, has ordered that he be interred in the Yavuz Selim Mosque alongside Selim I and Suleiman the Magnificent. He is survived by numerous sons and daughters, having taken one of the largest harems in the Empire's history."
 ottoman_dynasty.2.f:0 "With joy we were all weeping\nAnd on the trees we were climbing\nAnd for the sultan we watch\nWhence will we see him again"
 ottoman_dynasty.2.a:0 "The life of this world is an illusory pleasure."
 
 je_sick_man_vilayets:0 "Tanzimat: Organisation of the Vilayets"
 je_sick_man_vilayets_reason:0 "The old system of Eyalets has served its purpose and must now be reformed, with the title of 'Vali' replacing the previous 'Beylerbey' and new, defined and regularised system of responsibilities that will ensure all regions of our state are run along the same lines."
 
 je_sick_man_navy:0 "Tanzimat: Naval Reform"
 je_sick_man_navy_reason:0 "The navy has been long-neglected and is a hotbed of disloyalty. During our early wars with our rebellious vassal Muhammad Ali Pasha our navy threatened to defect to the Egyptians multiple times, and we are forced to rely on the support of foreign powers to defend our coasts and the straits. Rennovating the navy by developing our officer corps, fielding new detatchments and outfitting new, larger ships must be a priority."
 
 je_druze_christian_war_foreign:0 "Conflict in the Lebanon"
 je_druze_christian_war_foreign_reason:0 "Our interests in the Middle East mean that we must keep a close eye on the situation in Lebanon as it escalates to open conflict between the different religious communities there. Perhaps we can turn this to our advantage?"
 druze_christian_war_interest_tt:0 "The Porte has failed to supress unrest around Mount Lebanon"
 je_druze_christian_war_foreign_tt:0 "This journal entry will be removed if the [TUR.GetName] gets a handle on the situation"
 
 vilayet_events.1.t:0 "Reorganisation of the Provinces"
 vilayet_events.1.d:0 "With our much-needed administrative reform effort we have been able to reduce the extent of corruption and organise a proper system of duties for our provincial governors. We shall drag ourselves kicking and screaming into the 19th century!"
 vilayet_events.1.f:0 "'Beneath the Vali is the Mufettichi-Hukkiami or chief magistrate, the Muhasebeci in charge of finances, the Mektubcu in charge of post and the Defter-i Hakani Muduru who- it's probably easier if I just draw you a picture'"
 vilayet_events.1.a:0 "Bit by bit, we chip away at past."
 
 vilayet_events.2.t:0 "Bringing Egypt To Heel"
 vilayet_events.2.d:0 "Driving the Egyptian armies from Syria and returning the Levant to the Sultan's control has put us in an advantageous position against the rebellious Ali Pasha, nonetheless if we wish to fully reassert control over Egypt we face a difficult campaign through Sinai and into the Nile Valley. If we wished to avoid this, we could instead offer to confirm him as legitimate ruler of Egypt and make this office hereditary. As an added sweetener, we might afford him the honorary title "Khedive". This would place him above the rest of the Ottoman nobility, affording him the dignity of a vassal king."
 vilayet_events.2.f:0 "His Highness the Sultan has the intention to grant and to cause to be notified to Muhammed Ali the conditions of the arrangement here below: I. His Highness promises to grant to M. Ali, for himself and his descendants in direct line, the administration of the Pashalic of Egypt, and His Highness promises, furthermore..."
 vilayet_events.2.a:0 "Egypt remains important, offer him the position and title."
 vilayet_events.2.b:0 "This upstart may serve as vali, nothing more."
 vilayet_events.2.c:0 "We will settle for nothing less than conquest"
 vilayet_events.2.tta:0 "Egypt will become our Dominion, with the special ruler title of "Khedive". They will like this offer!"
 vilayet_events.2.ttb:0 "Egypt will become our Puppet, with no special status afforded them. This will insult them!"
 
 vilayet_events.3.t:0 "The Khedivate of Egypt?"
 vilayet_events.3.d:0 "After the disasterous loss of Syria to the Sultan's armies we have received diplomatic overtures from Constantinople. It seems that, in league with the western powers backing him, the Sultan means to offer us an accord. In exchange for annual tribute from our tax revenues and our formal submission to his authority, the dynasty of Muhammad Ali shall be permitted to maintain hereditary rule over Egypt and to function effectively as an autonomous vassal kingdom, whose ruler bears the title Khedive."
 vilayet_events.3.f:0 "V. All the treaties and all the laws of the Ottoman Empire shall be applied to Egypt and to the Pashalic of Acre, such as it has been hereabove designated, the same as to every other part of the Ottoman Empire. But the Sultan consents that, upon the condition of the regular payment of the above-named tribute, M. Ali and his descendants do gather in the name of the Sultan, and as delegates of His Highness throughout the provinces whose administration shall be to them intrusted."
 vilayet_events.3.a:0 "Let the Sultan know we accept this offer"
 vilayet_events.3.b:0 "Give no answer, we refuse this treaty"
 
 vilayet_events.4.t:0 "The Vilayet of Egypt?"
 vilayet_events.4.d:0 "After the disasterous loss of Syria to the Sultan's armies we have received diplomatic overtures from Constantinople. It seems that, in league with the western powers backing him, the Sultan means to offer us an accord. In exchange for annual tribute from our tax revenues and our formal submission to his authority, the dynasty of Muhammad Ali shall be permitted to maintain hereditary rule over Egypt and pass down the role of provincial governor to his descendants. However no special status is afforded them, an affront to their power and dignity."
 vilayet_events.4.f:0 "V. All the treaties and all the laws of the Ottoman Empire shall be applied to Egypt and to the Pashalic of Acre, such as it has been hereabove designated, the same as to every other part of the Ottoman Empire. But the Sultan consents that, upon the condition of the regular payment of the above-named tribute, M. Ali and his descendants do gather in the name of the Sultan, and as delegates of His Highness throughout the provinces whose administration shall be to them intrusted."
 vilayet_events.4.a:0 "Let the Sultan know we accept this offer"
 vilayet_events.4.b:0 "Give no answer, we refuse this treaty"
 
 vilayet_events.5.t:0 "Egypt Submits"
 vilayet_events.5.d:0 "Be it out of fear or conscience, the [c:EGY.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] of Egypt has submitted to us. We are most pleased with this outcome, and must now begin the hard work of reasserting out authority over Arabia."
 vilayet_events.5.f:0 "His prompt compliance with the orders of his sovereign, according to previous arrangement, has been agreeable to His Highness, who takes pleasure in giving proof of his kindly feelings by treating all his servants with perfect consideration, and who, considering the past events as having never existed, has deigned to grant a generous pardon to Muhammed Ali Pasha"
 vilayet_events.5.a:0 "Splendid"
 
 vilayet_events.6.t:0 "Egypt Refuses"
 vilayet_events.6.d:0 "No reply has come from Alexandria to our generous offer, as such we are now forced to review our options with respect to the Egyptian question. It seems that if we wish to bring Egypt back into the fold then military force will be our only choice."
 vilayet_events.6.f:0 "His noncompliance with the orders of his sovereign, according to previous arrangement, has been offensive to His Highness, who takes great joy in the prosecution of those who trespass against him and God, and who, considering the past events, has commanded his armies to put down the rebel Muhammed Ali Pasha"
 vilayet_events.6.a:0 "Unfortunate"
