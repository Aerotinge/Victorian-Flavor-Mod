  italy_1848.1.d: "The people of [SCOPE.sState('sicily_scope').GetName] have risen up against our rule."
  italy_1848.1.f: ""Since the cholera epidemic of 1837 which killed 70,000 people in [SCOPE.sState('sicily_scope').GetName], Sicilians have raised a sense of mistrust and recriminations towards the Bourbon power, accused of having voluntarily spread the pestilence by polluting water and air. Their hostility can also be found in the suppression of all forms of autonomy and the dominance of Neapolitan elements, the poverty of the island, the harsh police regime and violations of the commitments made by the government.\n\nThis social tension has now exploded into a full-scale popular revolt in Syracuse and Catania.""
