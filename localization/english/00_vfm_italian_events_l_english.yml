  italy_flavor.1.d: "A cholera epidemic is hitting [SCOPE.sState('sicily_scope').GetName] heavily. About 70,000 people have already died and the population is calling for help."
  italy_flavor.1.f: ""Doctors are completely unprepared for the disease as no one knows how it spreads and why, nor what treatments can be adopted, apart from the isolation of the sick in hospitals and quarantine. They know that poor sanitation is part of the problem, but there is no solution to that.\n\nCities lack sewage systems and the populace live in unsanitary houses. To make the situation worse, there is also the widespread distrust of the authorities, including the health ones.\n\nVictim of ignorance and prejudice, a large part of the population prefers to adopt remedies from popular tradition, such as holding cloves of garlic under the nose and trusting in the purifying power of fire with large bonfires are lit in the streets.""

  italy_1848.1.f: ""Since the cholera epidemic of 1837 which killed 70,000 people in [SCOPE.sState('sicily_scope').GetName], Sicilians have raised a sense of mistrust and recriminations towards the Bourbon power, accused of having voluntarily spread the pestilence by polluting water and air. Their hostility can also be found in the suppression of all forms of autonomy and the dominance of Neapolitan elements, the poverty of the island, the harsh police regime and violations of the commitments made by the government.\n\nThis social tension has now exploded into a full-scale popular revolt in Syracuse and Catania.""

  italy_1848.4.f: ""Our nation was unable to put down the Sicilian revolution. A large part of the population is attracted by the ideals established in [SCOPE.sCountry('sic_rev_scope').GetName] thanks to the revolution and would like them to expand here too.
